#### Experiment testing the accuracy of semantic/naive chunking methods.
#### Results: on a small document, don't even bother with semantic chunking (accuracy within 1%, but training time is 2-3x as long). For larger documents, marginal (2%) improvements were achieved, again with longer training times.
